# ðŸ¥· Wallpy Sensei

A dynamic wallpaper tool that allows you to change wallpapers based on the time of the day. The idea for this little weekend project came after I came across [this](https://www.mattvince.com/product/zelda-wind-waker-wallpaper-4-pack/) wallpaper pack. You can use it to change your wallpapers 24/7 and even add your own custom wallmaps. Try it!

## Installation and Setup

Common steps for all operating systems,
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/siphyshu/wallpy-sensei.git`
2. Move into the directory `cd ./wallpy-sensei`
3. Run the setup.py script `python3 ./setup.py "[wallpack_name]"` (wallpack_name from ./wallpaper-packs dir)

### Windows
1. Open "Task Scheduler" by searching in the start menu
2. Click on "Create Task" from the Actions menu on the right
3. Give it a suitable name such as "Wallpy Sensei Task" and Configure for [Windows 10]
4. Add two triggers: [On Startup], [On a schedule, repeat every 5 minutes indefinitely]
5. Add an action: [Start a program], Point it to the `./wallpy-sensei.py` script

### MacOS & Linux
The logic that tells the OS to periodically check the schedule and change the wallpaper isn't implemented yet. I will probably get to it soon but until I do so, feel free to contribute to the project by opening a pull request.

## To-Do
- [x] Update README.md
- [x] Add map.json for initial wallpacks
- [ ] Write "Adding Wallpacks" section for README.md
